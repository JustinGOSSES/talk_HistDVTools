### Title:
THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS IN LARGE ORGANIZATIONS

### Two Interconnected Topics:
1. Changing landscape of data visualization and analytical tools: Quick Overview of 1976-2016
2. Data visualization in large organizations:
  - What is their value to large organizations?
  - What matters in deciding what tools to adopt? What large organization characteristics influence their adoption?

  This is a timeline I created with the help of Knight School of Journalism's <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html" target="blank">"timeline.js</a> tool. It presents a list of key data visualization tools and puts their first releases in context of the new methods or technologies they were able to use or the patterns of tool development they followed. 

### Key Web Standards and Browsers Technologies:
  <a href="http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/#/evolution/night" target="blank">This</a> was developed as a google chrome team experiment with some outside consultancies in 2012. It is used in the presentation to point out that certain web-based data visualization methods and code libraries couldn't exist until widespread adoption of certain web standards in common browsers.
