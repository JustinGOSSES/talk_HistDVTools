### Two other webpages used in the presentation

#### A Timeline of Key Data Visualization Tools 1976-2016:

  This is a timeline I created with the help of Knight School of Journalism's <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html" target="blank">"timeline.js</a> tool. It presents a list of key data visualization tools and puts their first releases in context of the new methods or technologies they were able to use or the patterns of tool development they followed.

#### Evolution of the Web Data Visualization:
  <a href="http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/#/evolution/night" target="blank">This</a> was developed as a google chrome team experiment with some outside consultancies in 2012. It is used in the presentation to point out that certain web-based data visualization methods and code libraries couldn't exist until widespread adoption of certain web standards in common browsers.
