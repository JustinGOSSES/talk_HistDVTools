### Two other webpages used in the presentation

#### A <a href="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1O32FBDYO16WjoFSCsWS1d0oEuRo0C00q633nhhGZlNE&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650" taarget="blank">Timeline</a> of Key Data Visualization Tools 1976-2016:

  A timeline I created using the Knight School of Journalism's <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html" target="blank">"timeline.js</a> tool. It presents a list of key data visualization tools and puts their first releases in context of new methods or technologies they were able to use or patterns of tool development they followed.

#### Evolution of the Web Data Visualization:
  <a href="http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/#/evolution/night" target="blank">This</a> was developed as a google chrome team experiment with some outside consultancies in 2012. It is used in the presentation to point out that certain web-based data visualization methods and code libraries couldn't exist until widespread adoption of certain web standards in common browsers.
